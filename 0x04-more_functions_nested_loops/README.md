4. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Don't print 2 & 4.

6. Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

7. Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
The line should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

8. Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
The diagonal should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

Where size is the size of the square
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the square

10. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Each number or word should be separated by a space
You are allowed to use the standard library

11. Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
Where size is the size of the triangle
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the triangle
